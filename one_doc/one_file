<TTL>GUAM'S COAST GUARD RESERVE: RECOGNITION FOR A JOB WELL DONE -- HON. ROBERT A. UNDERWOOD (Extension of Remarks - September 19, 1994)</TTL>
<CENTER>HON. ROBERT A. UNDERWOOD</CENTER>
<CENTER>OF GUAM</CENTER>
<CENTER>in the House of Representatives</CENTER>
<CENTER>Monday, September 19, 1994</CENTER>
Mr. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend a group of citizens on Guam who give their time and energy to public service and rarely get the thanks they deserve. Today, we thank the Guam Coast Guard Reserve unit for its service, and congratulate our friends for receiving the 1994 National Defense Transportation Association Award.
The Coast Guard Reserve unit helps both the military and the civilians on Guam. It provides support for defense munitions loading. It helps with the Christmas holiday loadout operations. And the Reserves help keep our commercial port operating by providing security for vessels with dangerous cargo onboard.
Of course, Guam is often subjected to devastating natural disasters and we rely on our reservists to pull us through. In August 1993, when Guam was rocked by an earthquake measuring 8.2 on the Richter scale, members of the Coast Guard Reserve were among the first on the scene to make sure the harbor and other facilities were safe for use. The unit also responded to over 100 chemical spills, making sure shipping lanes were safe and the environment was protected.
The Guam Coast Guard Reserve unit will receive its award in St. Louis, MO, on October 2, 1994. Kongradulasim to our friends in the Reserves. Bunitu che'cho'-miyu.
